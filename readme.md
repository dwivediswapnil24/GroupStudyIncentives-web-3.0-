# GroupStudyIncentives

## Project Title
GroupStudyIncentives

## Project Description
GroupStudyIncentives is a decentralized smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that incentivizes collaborative learning by rewarding participants in study groups. It allows users to create study groups with a set reward pool and participant limit. Once the participant limit is reached, rewards are distributed equally among all members of the group. The platform aims to foster teamwork and motivate users to engage in educational activities.

## Project Vision
The vision of GroupStudyIncentives is to create a decentralized platform that encourages collaborative learning and rewards knowledge-sharing. By integrating blockchain technology, the project ensures transparency, security, and trust among participants.

## Key Features
1. **Create Study Groups**: Users can create study groups with a specific reward pool and participant limit.
   - Set a custom group name and description.
   - Define a reward pool to incentivize participants.
   - Specify the maximum number of participants.

2. **Join Study Groups**: Participants can join active study groups that have not yet reached their participant limit.
   - Ensure fair participation by limiting group size.
   - Groups become inactive automatically once the participant limit is reached.

3. **Reward Distribution**: Automatically distribute rewards equally among all participants when a study group is completed.
   - Rewards are added to the participants' balances.
   - Transparency in reward allocation ensures trust.

4. **Withdraw Rewards**: Participants can withdraw their accumulated rewards securely.
   - Withdraw funds directly to their Ethereum wallets.

5. **Access Group Details**: View all active and completed study groups.
   - Transparency of group information for all users.

6. **Events for Transparency**: The contract emits events for key actions, such as:
   - Group creation.
   - Participant joining.
   - Reward withdrawal.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a front-end interface for better user interaction.
- Add support for group moderation and communication.
- Enable dynamic reward adjustments based on participant performance.
- Integrate with other blockchain networks for scalability and reduced transaction fees.
